# ViolenceABM


## Introduction
This code is to create an agent-based model (ABM) approach of simulating hostile interactions between enemy gang members. As such, one can experiment with emergent behaivors based on potential idealized interventions which may mitigate those hostile interactions.

## Example
To understand how one might use this ABM, look at HOSTILE_REMOVAL_INTERACTION.R; this is code to test removal of hostile agents within the ABM to see the effect of levels of hostile interactions based on those removals. As it is presently, this code will run 100 versions of experiments removing 5, 10, and 15% of the hostile agents in each version with 1000 timesteps per iteration of removals -- it takes space and time! 

## Note 
Currently, it is assumed that the working directory is ViolenceABM, as this has not been transformed (yet!) into an R package.

## Creation 
This code was written by Thomas Laetsch to be used for non-commercial (academic in nature) purposes.
